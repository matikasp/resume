\section*{About Me}
I have just finished third semester as a Computer Science student at the University of Warsaw, Poland. I am currently seeking an internship or part-time job to gain real-world work experience. I have a strong interest in mathematics and algorithms, and I am a quick and adaptive learner.

    \item Participated in Hackarena 2.0 Hackathon
    \item Finalist of the STEM competition organized by the Warsaw University of Technology during high school
\end{itemize}

\section*{Skills}
After completing my first three semesters of studies at the University, I have developed an understanding of programming languages such as: C/C++, NASM x86 Assembly, Java, and Python. I am also familiar with object-oriented (OOP) and imperative programming paradigms. Additionally, I possess knowledge of operating systems and computer architecture, and I have a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures. I also have an understanding of concurrent programming.
Beyond practical programming skills, I am particularly drawn to theoretical computer science areas such as automata theory, formal languages, and computational complexity.
\section*{Languages}
